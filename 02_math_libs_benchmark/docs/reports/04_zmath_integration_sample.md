## Key Observations

### Performance Patterns
1. **zmath shows strong performance in matrix operations**, particularly benefiting from its SIMD-first design
2. **SIMD mode provides 20-30% performance improvements** for zmath operations that can leverage end-to-end F32x4 processing
3. **zalgebra shows competitive matrix performance** due to its column-major layout being cache-friendly for certain operations
4. **zm (griush) provides balanced performance** across different operation types

### Scalar Parity Validation
- All libraries produce equivalent results for the same mathematical operations
- zmath's broadcast scalar extraction (`result[0]`) maintains numerical parity
- Vector operations correctly handle w-component for 3D math consistency

### SIMD Track Benefits
- Clear performance improvements when zmath can avoid scalar extraction
- Demonstrates the library's intended SIMD-optimized usage patterns
- Provides insight into potential optimizations for SIMD-heavy applications

## Methodology Notes

- Results show mean execution time with 95% confidence intervals
- Each benchmark runs for sufficient iterations to achieve statistical significance
- Memory allocation overhead is tracked and minimized
- Compiler optimizations are prevented using `doNotOptimizeAway`
- All libraries use equivalent mathematical inputs and comparable operations

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Run basic comparison (scalar parity)
zig build run -- full

# Focus on vector operations with SIMD
zig build run -- vec --simd

# Compare matrix performance  
zig build run -- matrix

# Full suite with SIMD optimizations
zig build run -- full --simd
```

This integration provides developers with comprehensive performance data to make informed decisions about math library selection based on their specific use cases and performance requirements.
